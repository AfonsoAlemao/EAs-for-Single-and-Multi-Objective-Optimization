.MemoryUsage (if > 0.8, CLP should decrease)
.ProcessorLoad (if > 0.8, CLP should decrease)
.OutNetThroughput - InpNetThroughput = Throughput aumenta -> CLP diminui
.OutBandwidth (quando aumenta, CLP deve diminuir)
.Latency aumenta, CLP aumenta (High latencies mean that it’s better to process data locally, so CLP increases)

CLP_variation (Negative, Null, Positive)
ProcessorLoad (Low, Med, High)
MemoryUsage (Low, Med, High)
Throughput (Negative, Null, Positive)
OutBandwidth (Low, Med, High)
Latency (Low, Med, High)
Boss (NNegative, Negative, Other)


If MemoryUsage is Low, then Critical1 is Off
If MemoryUsage is Med, then Critical1 is Off
If MemoryUsage is High, then Critical1 is On

If ProcessorLoad is Low, then Critical2 is Off
If ProcessorLoad is Med, then Critical2 is Off
If ProcessorLoad is High, then Critical2 is On

If Critical1 is On or Criteria2 is On, then Critical is On

If OutBandwidth is Low, then PhysicalCritical is On
If OutBandwidth is Med, then PhysicalCritical is Off
If OutBandwidth is High, then PhysicalCritical is Off


Boss is NNegative (CLP não pode diminuir)
Boss is Negative (CLP deve diminuir)
Boss is Other (Latency and Throuhgput vão decidir)

If Critical is On and PhysicalCritical is On, then Boss is NNegative
If Critical is On and PhysicalCritical is Off, then Boss is Negative
If Critical is Off and PhysicalCritical is On, then Boss is NNegative
If Critical is Off and PhysicalCritical is Off, then Boss is Other


aux=expetativa de CLP_variation

If Throughput is Negative and Latency is Low, then aux is Positive
If Throughput is Negative and Latency is Med, then aux is Positive
If Throughput is Negative and Latency is High, then aux is Positive

If Throughput is Null and Latency is Low, then aux is Negative
If Throughput is Null and Latency is Med, then aux is Null
If Throughput is Null and Latency is High, then aux is Positive

If Throughput is Positive and Latency is Low, then aux is Negative
If Throughput is Positive and Latency is Med, then aux is Negative
If Throughput is Positive and Latency is High, then aux is Positive

aux (Negative, Null, Positive)
Boss (NNegative, Negative, Other)

If Boss is NNegative and aux is Negative, then CLP_variation is Null
If Boss is NNegative and aux is Null, then CLP_variation is Null
If Boss is NNegative and aux is Positive, then CLP_variation is Positive

If Boss is Negative and aux is Negative, then CLP_variation is Negative
If Boss is Negative and aux is Null, then CLP_variation is Negative
If Boss is Negative and aux is Positive, then CLP_variation is Negative

If Boss is Other and aux is Negative, then CLP_variation is Negative
If Boss is Other and aux is Null, then CLP_variation is Null
If Boss is Other and aux is Positive, then CLP_variation is Positive
